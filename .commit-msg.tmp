feat: Session 6 — multi-project architecture, modular AI tool registry, UI fixes

Distribution infrastructure:
- Centralized project-config.ts replaces all hardcoded process.cwd() paths (14 files)
- CLI commands: dev-track init, start, projects (scaffolds data, registers projects, generates cursor rules)
- Central registry at ~/.dev-track/ with per-project data isolation
- Project switcher dropdown in sidebar with hot-swap (POST /api/v1/projects/switch)
- GET /api/v1/project and /api/v1/projects endpoints

AI tool registry refactor:
- Replaced monolithic 718-line tools.ts with modular registry (server/ai/tools/)
- 16 domain modules, ~40 tools total, auto-collected by registry
- New tools: update_state, update_idea, start/end_session, Actions CRUD,
  context_recovery r/w, preferences r/w, user_profile r/w, write_project_file,
  list_directory, scan_codebase, detailed git_log, git_branches, integrations_status

UI improvements:
- Kanban drag-and-drop via @dnd-kit (ISS-004 resolved)
- AI provider keys moved to Integrations tab as AI Providers section (ISS-013)
- Helicone org_id field + credential sync to AI proxy (ISS-015)
- Fixed Changelog crash on undefined items/files_touched (ISS-017)
- Fixed Ideas crash on null array fields (ISS-018)
- Fixed Docs ToC scroll in nested overflow container (ISS-019)
- Sidebar shows project name prominently with dev-track as subtle branding

Tested: Pillar initialized successfully with isolated data at ~/.dev-track/projects/pillar/
