The coding AI's attention is consumed by the coding task. Asking it to also remember tracking duties is like asking a surgeon to also take notes during surgery. Three approaches to fix, in order of reliability: (1) Structural: tool-level validation that catches unlogged changes (dashboard widget, session-end gate, git hooks). (2) Separation: a second lightweight AI that only does tracking, triggered by file changes (IDEA-014). (3) Instructions: better-positioned text in the cursor rule (already done, weakest approach). The user's key insight: 'the minute you introduce the human into the loop, they forget too.' The same is true for AI. The system must be self-enforcing.",
