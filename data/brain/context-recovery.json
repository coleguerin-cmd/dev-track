  "briefing": "Session 7 complete (Feb 8 night). Massive infrastructure session. Shipped: Entity Model v2 (14 entity types, complete data migration, store/routes/tools/UI rewrite), full Docs system (CRUD + AI tools + auto-generation), headless AI agent runner, automation engine with trigger hooks, scheduler (cron), 5 built-in automations, project init endpoint. Automations verified live: nightly audit (49 tool calls, $10.17), weekly report (12 tool calls, $1.97). 14 auto-generated documentation files created by AI. Scheduler race condition found and fixed. Cost controls added: master kill switch, budget enforcement, cooldown, model tier downgrade. ALL AUTOMATIONS CURRENTLY OFF (kill switch flipped). 4 commits, ~19K lines shipped.",
  "hot_context": [
    "AUTOMATIONS ARE OFF. Master kill switch in data/ai/config.json → automations.enabled: false. Must flip to true to re-enable.",
    "Automation cost was $19.28 for one round on premium models. Default tier downgraded to 'standard'. Budget limit: $5/day.",
    "ISS-021: Automation controls not in Settings UI — users must edit JSON directly. Next session priority.",
    "ISS-022: Helicone shows $0 for Opus 4.6 requests — model not in their pricing database. 32 requests show n/a provider.",
    "ISS-020: Sessions 6-7 missing from velocity log. Created by nightly audit AI.",
    "14 auto-generated docs in data/docs/ — system overviews, API reference, getting started, data model reference.",
    "3 new ideas captured: IDEA-038 (preserve cursor settings on init), IDEA-040 (infer persona from git), IDEA-039 (cron profile iteration).",
    "IDEA-041 (automation settings UI) and IDEA-042 (brain note dedup) — captured at session end.",
    "The AI nightly audit independently: reassessed all system health, triaged 8 ideas, created ISS-020, updated context recovery, ran codebase scan.",
    "Dev servers: API on 24680, UI on 24681. npm run dev starts both.",
    "User wants depth and precision over cost out of the gate, then detune."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Don't turn automations on without checking budget — $19/run on premium is too expensive for daily use.",
    "Brain note dedup needed — got 3 duplicate weekly reports (BN-015, BN-018, BN-019) from race condition.",
    "Helicone cost tracking broken for Opus 4.6 and some requests not routing through proxy at all.",
    "AI chat agent still never tested in browser — remains the #1 blocker for dogfooding.",
    "Context window was very long this session. Fresh session strongly recommended."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "FIRST: Build automation settings UI (ISS-021) — users need to control the kill switch from the browser.",
    "SECOND: Test AI chat in browser — open localhost:24681, send real messages, fix what breaks.",
    "THIRD: Dogfood on Pillar — run dev-track init with the new AI init endpoint.",
    "Fix brain note dedup before turning automations back on.",
    "Consider adding a cost dashboard widget to the main Dashboard view.",
    "Session 6-7 velocity data gap (ISS-020) — either backfill or accept and move on.",
    "The persona inference from git (IDEA-040) could be a quick win during init — commit messages reveal a lot."
