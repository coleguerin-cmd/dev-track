  "briefing": "Session 2 complete. dev-track is running — all 11 UI views render in Chrome, server boots clean, GitHub repo live at coleguerin-cmd/dev-track. Fixed Tailwind/PostCSS config, codebase scanner root, and CSS import ordering. Added cold-start instructions to cursor rule so every new AI conversation auto-orients before responding. ISS-001 (critical: UI untested) is resolved. Remaining: TypeScript build (ISS-002), integration testing (ISS-003), kanban DnD (ISS-004). IDEA-008 captured for web-based multi-user future.",
  "hot_context": [
    "UI works in Chrome (not Cursor's built-in browser)",
    "GitHub repo: coleguerin-cmd/dev-track (public, 3 commits on master)",
    "Cold-start cursor rule added — THIS conversation was the first to test it. Validate in next fresh chat.",
    "ISS-001 resolved (UI renders). ISS-002 (TS build) is the next critical issue.",
    "8 ideas captured, 1 new this session (IDEA-008: web-based multi-user)"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "TypeScript build (npm run build) has NEVER been run — could have type errors",
    "Integration plugins still untested with real API keys",
    "Cold-start cursor rule is untested in a fresh conversation — validate next session"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "NEXT SESSION: Open a fresh chat to validate cold-start rule works",
    "Then run npm run build and fix any TypeScript errors (ISS-002)",
    "Then try using dev-track to manage a real Pillar development session",
    "Consider testing one integration (GitHub is simplest) with real credentials"
  ]
