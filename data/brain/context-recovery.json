  "briefing": "Session 9 was the biggest session yet — 47 files changed, 7400 lines, 15 items shipped, 48 points. Key deliverables: (1) Audits tab end-to-end with markdown rendering, time filters, analytics charts, right sidebar entity breakdown. (2) Chat agent reframed as 'investigation + handoff layer' — system prompt scoped, AgentActivityPanel for real-time tool visibility, SessionChangesTray for Pillar-style entity mutation tracking. (3) Five bugs fixed including ISS-039 (critical) — the refreshKey pattern was remounting ALL views on every WebSocket event, destroying state app-wide. Also fixed ISS-035 (config deep merge + cache invalidation), ISS-036 (agent scope), ISS-037 (transparency), ISS-038 (changes tray). Git is clean — all work committed and pushed to origin/master. Automations ON ($10/day, standard tier).",
  "hot_context": [
    "Git clean — all session 9 work committed and pushed (commit 001cfd7)",
    "AI chat agent browser-tested this session — activity panel, changes tray, scope boundaries all working",
    "ISS-039 (critical) fixed: refreshKey pattern was destroying view state on every WS event",
    "Chat agent role crystallized: investigation + handoff layer, NOT a code editor",
    "Audits tab fully built: recorder, engine wiring, API, rich UI with entity breakdowns",
    "Automations ON — standard tier, $10/day budget, 60min cooldown",
    "Entity model expanded: epics, milestones, releases AI tools added",
    "4 upfactoring ideas captured: IDEA-065 (handoff pattern), IDEA-066 (bidirectional context), IDEA-067 (view lifecycle), IDEA-068 (Cursor-ready prompts)",
    "Open issues: ISS-003 (Helicone), ISS-006 (AI drift), ISS-012 (conversation bridge), ISS-022 (Helicone $0), ISS-031 (max concurrent), ISS-034 (semantic watcher)"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "ISS-034 (critical): Semantic file watcher still broken — blocks reliable automation triggers",
    "Helicone integration still FAILING (ISS-003) — no real cost data flowing",
    "View-level data lifecycle not implemented yet (IDEA-067) — global refresh removed but views may miss updates",
    "ai-watcher and ui-design-overhaul both stalled in_progress — need status updates or demotion",
    "Large brain notes (BN-015, 018, 019, 020) still bloat context"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "PRIORITY 1: Fix ISS-034 (semantic file watcher) — critical for automation reliability",
    "PRIORITY 2: Browser test chat improvements fully (activity panel, changes tray, handoff behavior)",
    "PRIORITY 3: Build view-level data lifecycle (IDEA-067) to replace removed global refresh",
    "Consider: promote IDEA-065 (handoff pattern) and IDEA-068 (Cursor-ready prompts) to roadmap",
    "Consider: dogfood DevTrack on Pillar now that chat agent and audits are working",
    "Consider: archive large brain notes to reduce context loading"
