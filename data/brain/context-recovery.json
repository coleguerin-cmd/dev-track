  "briefing": "Session 4 complete (Feb 7, evening). MASSIVE session: built the entire AI-in-the-loop foundation. Chat-first architecture validated — persistent sidebar agent with 25 tools, multi-provider model routing (OpenAI GPT-5.2, Anthropic Sonnet 4.5, Google Gemini 3), SSE streaming, tool call visualization. Auto-model-discovery from provider APIs (58 models found) so we never hardcode model IDs again. Also shipped: graph layman descriptions (ISS-007 resolved), docs wiki overhaul with markdown rendering + ToC. Architecture plan created for full AI system. User profile built for Cole. 22 ideas captured total (5 new this session). Key business decision: NOT open source — building a paid product (lightweight local daemon + web platform model). v0.1 goal is dogfooding on Pillar and Landmark immediately.",
  "hot_context": [
    "Dev servers: API on port 24680, UI on port 24681 (may shift to 24682-24684 if Vite grabs others)",
    "AI chat is LIVE: click blue circle bottom-right in UI. Routes to Claude Sonnet 4.5 by default. All 3 providers configured with API keys in .credentials.json",
    "Helicone BYOK configured. Proxy enabled in config. Sessions/Properties/Users/Cache features planned (IDEA-018) but not integrated yet",
    "Now backlog: ai-chat-agent (L, in_progress), test-integrations (M, pending — deprioritize to next). 1 slot free.",
    "22 ideas captured (IDEA-001 through IDEA-022). IDEA-021 (paid product distribution) and IDEA-019 (Pillar tray system) are highest priority for next iteration",
    "3 open issues: ISS-003 (integrations untested, medium), ISS-004 (kanban DnD, low), ISS-006 (AI drift, high — partially addressed by chat agent)",
    "Model auto-discovery: router queries provider APIs on startup, classifies by pattern. 58 models found. No hardcoded IDs.",
    "User profile for Cole in data/ai/profiles.json — injected into every AI chat system prompt",
    "Business model: NOT open source. Paid product: local daemon + web platform. Free tier (1 project, limited AI), Pro ($25-40/seat/mo), Team ($60+/seat/mo)",
    "Changelog has 18 entries across 4 sessions. 7 new entries this session."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "AI chat works but needs real-world testing. First user message succeeded with Claude Sonnet 4.5. Tool calling untested in browser yet.",
    "Server crashes on tsx watch reload when port is held (EADDRINUSE). Need graceful shutdown or port-in-use handling.",
    "Settings UI for AI keys not built yet — keys only configurable via .credentials.json file directly.",
    "Helicone proxy enabled but Sessions/Properties/Users features not integrated — just basic cost logging for now.",
    "ISS-006 (AI context drift) partially addressed by chat agent but background auto-monitoring (IDEA-014) still needed for full solution.",
    "The open-source-launch backlog item needs updating — user explicitly said 'fuck open source I wanna get paid'. Business model shifted to paid product."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "FIRST: Test the AI chat in the browser. Send messages, verify tool calls work, check streaming renders properly.",
    "THEN: Build Settings UI for AI config (API keys, model preferences, feature flags) so it's not manual JSON editing.",
    "CONSIDER: Start dogfooding on Pillar — run dev-track init on the Pillar project, use the chat for planning.",
    "PRIORITY: The ai-watcher (background monitoring) is the next big feature after chat is polished. It solves ISS-006.",
    "BUSINESS: Start a design doc for the paid product architecture (local daemon + web platform). IDEA-021 has the framework."
