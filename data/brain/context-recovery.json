  "briefing": "Session 6 complete (Feb 8, late night). Massive infrastructure session. Shipped: multi-project architecture (init/start/projects CLI, central registry at ~/.dev-track/, project switcher with hot-swap), modular AI tool registry (40 tools across 16 domains replacing monolithic tools.ts), Kanban DnD, AI provider keys in Integrations, Helicone org_id sync, 3 UI bug fixes (Changelog crash, Ideas click, Docs ToC scroll). Pillar initialized with isolated data. Deep product discussion: defined complete entity model v2 spec (14 entities) for enterprise-grade project management. ENTITY-MODEL-V2.md written as the blueprint. 47 files changed, committed. Next session: implement entity model v2 refactor top to bottom.",
  "hot_context": [
    "ENTITY-MODEL-V2.md in data/designs/ — the COMPLETE blueprint for next session's refactor. Read this FIRST.",
    "Dev servers: API on 24680, UI on 24681. npm run dev starts both.",
    "Pillar initialized at ~/.dev-track/projects/pillar/data/. Landmark not yet initialized.",
    "Tool registry at server/ai/tools/ — 16 modules, ~40 tools. Add new tools by creating files in this directory.",
    "project-config.ts is the centralized config module — all server files use it instead of process.cwd().",
    "ISS-006 (AI context drift) still open — structural enforcement still needed.",
    "7 ideas captured this session (IDEA-031 through IDEA-037). Key: IDEA-035 (opinionated git settings), IDEA-037 (AI-unique views).",
    "User wants: enterprise-grade PM tool that replaces Jira+Linear+Notion+GitHub, fully AI-managed.",
    "User explicitly said: 'have more, not less' — build every feature, AI manages complexity, user sees clean views.",
    "User wants AI to suggest milestones/releases, not manage them manually.",
    "User wants periodic full AI audit — on session end, on changelog, or push-button."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "The entity model v2 refactor touches EVERY layer: types, store, routes, tools, UI. Plan the execution order carefully.",
    "Migration path must preserve all existing data. backlog→roadmap, state.json→systems, actions→deprecated.",
    "Context window was very long this session — user was throwing a lot. Fresh session for the refactor is critical.",
    "npm link crashes Cursor — use 'npx tsx path/to/cli' for dogfooding commands.",
    "Server crashes on tsx watch reload when port is held (EADDRINUSE). Kill node processes before restart.",
    "Changelog entries use files_changed not files_touched — UI now handles both but types need updating in v2."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "FIRST: Read ENTITY-MODEL-V2.md. It has every entity, every field, every relationship, every enum, and the migration path.",
    "Execution order: (1) shared/types.ts — new type definitions, (2) data migration script, (3) store.ts refactor, (4) API routes, (5) AI tools update, (6) UI views.",
    "Start with types + data migration. Get the foundation right before touching any UI.",
    "After refactor: initialize on Pillar and Landmark to validate the model with real projects.",
    "The init wizard (IDEA-032) should come AFTER the entity model is solid — it needs stable entities to populate.",
    "Consider: the entity model discussion captured in this session should become an ADR (Architecture Decision Record)."
