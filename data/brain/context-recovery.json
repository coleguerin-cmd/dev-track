  "briefing": "Session 11 in progress: Infrastructure work on change tracking system. New files added (change-queue.ts, hooks.ts) and automation engine modified. 4 audit runs executed (0026-0029). Git shows uncommitted work across 20+ files. Session objective is docs validation and multi-project readiness, but current work appears to be automation infrastructure improvements. No completed roadmap items yet this session. All open issues remain valid (ISS-034 semantic watcher is critical blocker, ISS-043 Anthropic caching is high-priority cost optimization).",
  "hot_context": [
    "server/automation/change-queue.ts - NEW infrastructure file",
    "server/routes/hooks.ts - NEW webhook/trigger infrastructure",
    "server/automation/engine.ts - Modified automation engine",
    "server/ai/tools/backlog.ts, ideas.ts, issues.ts - AI tool updates",
    "data/audits/runs/run-0026 through run-0029 - Recent automation execution",
    "20+ uncommitted data files - Session state not yet committed"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Session 11 has uncommitted work - 20+ modified files plus 2 new infrastructure files not yet committed to git",
    "Change queue shows 'no unprocessed changes' but git status shows substantial uncommitted work - possible disconnect between change tracking and actual file state",
    "ISS-034 (semantic file watcher) remains CRITICAL blocker - prevents reliable automation triggers from external edits",
    "Session objective mentions 'docs validation' and 'Landmark readiness' but current work appears to be automation infrastructure - potential scope drift"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "PRIORITY 1: Commit the current work (change-queue.ts, hooks.ts, automation engine updates) with clear commit message describing what was built",
    "PRIORITY 2: Return to session 11 objective - browser test Docs tab end-to-end (three-column layout, Mermaid, cost modal, sub-pages)",
    "PRIORITY 3: Audit docs prompts for project-agnosticism - strip DevTrack-specific references before Landmark port",
    "PRIORITY 4: Test multi-project switching and profile persistence",
    "PRIORITY 5: Address ISS-043 (Anthropic prompt caching) - potential 90% cost savings on docs generation",
    "Consider: Is the change-queue infrastructure work a prerequisite for the session objective, or is this scope creep?"
