  "briefing": "Built dev-track from scratch in one session: 79 files, full server + UI + CLI + 8 integration plugins + AI brain + codebase scanner. Server boots clean, API tested, codebase scanner found 664 files / 139K lines in Pillar in 289ms. UI has NOT been tested in browser yet — that's the critical next step. Need to boot Vite, see what renders, fix what's broken, then populate with Pillar data.",
  "hot_context": [
    "Server works: port 24680, all API endpoints tested",
    "UI is untested in browser — Vite + Tailwind + React may have issues",
    "Codebase scanner works and scanned Pillar successfully",
    "7 ideas captured in ideas/items.json from this conversation",
    "Tool needs a real name (currently 'dev-track')"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "UI has never been rendered — could have import issues, Tailwind config problems, or component bugs",
    "No TypeScript build has been attempted yet",
    "Integration plugins use real external APIs but haven't been tested with actual credentials"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "NEXT SESSION: Boot the UI (npm run dev), see what renders, fix everything broken",
    "Then populate with Pillar data to start using it for real",
    "Then use it for one real development session on Pillar to validate the workflow",
    "Then decide on extraction to own repo and naming"
