  "briefing": "Session 8 ended with a comprehensive audit. The project is at 76% health with 89 items shipped across 8 sessions. The #1 critical blocker remains unchanged: the AI chat agent has been in_progress for 9+ days without browser testing. Session 8 shipped 12 items including: automation settings UI (completed), activity log sidebar tab, rich tool tray in chat, entity dedup, backlog card expansion, and multiple UI fixes. 11 issues were resolved. However, the chat agent itself—the core product—has never been tested in a real browser conversation. 27 files are modified and uncommitted to git. Automations are ON (standard tier, $10/day budget). The next session MUST browser-test the AI chat or change its status to reflect reality.",

    "PRIORITY 1: Open browser, test AI chat end-to-end (send message, verify tool calls, check responses)",
    "PRIORITY 2: Commit all pending changes to git (27 modified files)",
    "PRIORITY 3: Update ai-chat-agent status based on browser test results",
    "Consider: dogfood on Pillar if chat works, or pivot to fixing what's broken if it doesn't",
    "Consider: archive or summarize large brain notes to reduce context bloat",
