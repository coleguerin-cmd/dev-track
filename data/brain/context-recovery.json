  "briefing": "Nightly audit completed Feb 8. Project at 74% health (down from 76%). Key findings: (1) AI chat agent is the #1 priority — in_progress since Feb 7, foundation built but NEVER tested in browser with real conversations. This blocks everything downstream. (2) Entity Model v2 shipped successfully — 14 entities, migration complete, routes/tools/UI updated. (3) Automation engine, scheduler, and headless AI runner built (commit ca10e5e) but untested. (4) 3 open issues: ISS-003 (integrations untested, Helicone FAILING), ISS-006 (AI context drift — partial mitigations, structural fix via automation engine pending), ISS-012 (conversation bridge — large effort, not started). (5) CLI downgraded to degraded (50%) — never tested against live server, npm link crashes Cursor. (6) Integrations downgraded to degraded (45%) — Helicone test failing. (7) Codebase scan data stale since Feb 7 — needs fresh scan post-v2 refactor. (8) 5 ideas promoted to backlog, 1 dismissed (open source), 2 validated (init wizard, product audit). (9) Session velocity: avg 10.8 items/session, 32.2 points/session across 5 tracked sessions.",
  "hot_context": [
    "AI chat agent (ai-chat-agent) is in_progress in Now horizon — test in browser is the SINGLE most important next step",
    "Helicone integration is FAILING (test_result=fail as of Feb 8 01:56 UTC) — investigate credential sync",
    "Automation engine + scheduler + headless runner built but untested — 5 seeded automations (session-audit, change-tracker, nightly-audit, weekly-report, docs-refresh)",
    "Codebase scan stale since Feb 7 20:21 UTC — needs fresh scan after entity model v2 + tool registry refactor",
    "CLI is degraded (50%) — never tested against live server, npm link workaround needed",
    "Context recovery was stale — referenced entity model v2 as future work but it's now shipped",
    "IDEA-004 (open source) dismissed — contradicted BN-013 (paid product decision)",
    "IDEA-027 (conversation bridge) elevated to critical/exploring — solves ISS-006 + ISS-012 structurally",
    "Session tracking may be missing sessions 6-7 velocity data — only 5 sessions in velocity log",
    "ISS-006 path to resolution: (1) chat agent working → (2) headless runner tested → (3) change-tracker automation validated"

  "warnings": [
    "AI chat agent has been in_progress for 2 days without browser testing — risk of accumulated bugs",
    "Helicone integration failing — blocks AI cost tracking for dogfooding",
    "Codebase scan data is 24+ hours stale — architecture graph may show outdated information",
    "Velocity data incomplete — sessions 6-7 not in velocity log, totals may undercount",
    "CLI never tested against live server — could have fundamental issues",
    "5 seeded automations exist but none have been executed — automation engine is theoretical until tested"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "FIRST: Open browser, test AI chat with real conversation. Fix any issues. This unblocks everything.",
    "SECOND: Investigate Helicone test failure — check credentials sync and API endpoint",
    "Run fresh codebase scan to update stale architecture data",
    "Log sessions 6-7 velocity data to keep metrics accurate",
    "Test one automation (e.g., session-audit) via headless runner to validate the engine",
    "Start dogfooding on Pillar — the forcing function for product validation"
