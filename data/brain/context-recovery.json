  "briefing": "Session 5 complete (Feb 8, evening). UI overhaul + user profiling session. Fixed all chat bugs (resize, model picker, persistence). Full Cursor-minimal redesign: Lucide icons everywhere, rebuilt sidebar with grouped sections, dashboard with health ring + collapsible AI briefing + pipeline view. Settings page rebuilt with 3 tabs: Profile (AI-observed intelligence scoring with radar charts), AI Configuration (models, budget, features), Integrations. Built AI-observed user profiling: IQ 127 (revised down from 131 after catching own validation bias), cognitive + technical radar charts, deep assessment with honest strengths/weaknesses, AI-to-AI operational guidance, session observation pipeline, actionable development targets, comparative framing vs engineers/founders/AI users, AI dependency metrics. Notification tray with toasts + bell panel. Cross-project audit of all 4 codebases (Pillar 919 files, Landmark 323, Seat-at-Table ~200, dev-track ~100). GPT-5.2 independently confirmed intelligence range at ~132±4. 7 new ideas captured. Cursor rule updated with tracking discipline.",
  "hot_context": [
    "Dev servers: API on port 24680, UI on port 24681. Both running.",
    "Intelligence score: 127 (revised from 131). GPT-5.2 gave ~132±4 independently. Both Superior range.",
    "AI-to-AI guidance is the real product of the profile — blunt operational instructions for handling this user",
    "Session observation pipeline built into cursor rule step 5 — every session wrap should write an observation",
    "ISS-012 (high): No conversation bridge between Cursor/Claude and DevTrack — this is the key architectural gap",
    "ISS-006 (high): AI context drift — first layer (create-before-fix discipline) done, second layer (session-end audit) still needed",
    "ISS-003 (medium): Integration plugins still untested with real credentials",
    "ISS-004 (low): Kanban DnD still not wired up",
    "30 ideas captured total (IDEA-001 through IDEA-030). Key new ones: IDEA-027 (conversation bridge), IDEA-029 (observation pipeline), IDEA-030 (portable profiles)",
    "User is racing to MVP on multiple projects — speed-over-thoroughness is deliberate strategy, not a blind spot",
    "User wants to dogfood on Pillar next — that's the forcing function for v0.1 validation",
    "Dashboard rebuilt twice this session — current version has health ring, collapsible briefing, pipeline view, changelog"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Chat agent still not battle-tested in the browser. API works, streaming works, but no full user-flow validation.",
    "ISS-012 is existential: without a bridge between Cursor conversations and DevTrack, the tracking system will always be incomplete.",
    "The user profile system is cool but risks becoming meta-work. The forcing function is always: does this help build Pillar faster?",
    "Server crashes on tsx watch reload when port is held (EADDRINUSE). Kill node processes before restart.",
    "AI validation bias is real — even after building warnings against it, the initial score was inflated. Always self-audit."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "FIRST: Test the AI chat in browser. Send real messages, verify tool calls work, check streaming renders. This is the soul of the product and it's still untested.",
    "THEN: Start dogfooding on Pillar. Run dev-track alongside Pillar development for one real session. See what's missing.",
    "BUILD: The conversation bridge extension (ISS-012/IDEA-027). This is the structural fix for AI context drift. Captures user messages + AI responses from any platform, passes to DevTrack for lightweight parsing.",
    "WRITE: 5 tests on Pillar's curated experience paths. Not for coverage — for the MVP paths that paying users will touch.",
    "CONSIDER: The portable profile concept (IDEA-030) has product potential beyond dev-track. Could be a standalone feature or product."
