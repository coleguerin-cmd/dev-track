Session 8 was closed by editing JSON directly and the session-end-audit never fired.",

On session/log.json change: check if any session went active→completed → fire session_ended. On issues/items.json change: check for new issues → fire issue_created, check for status changes → fire issue_resolved. This makes triggers code-path-independent — works regardless of whether change came from API, Cursor, or direct file edit."
