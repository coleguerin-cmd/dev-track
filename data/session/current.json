  "plan": [
    "1. Browser test Docs tab end-to-end (three-column layout, Mermaid, cost modal, page tree, sub-pages)",
    "2. Audit docs prompts for project-agnosticism — strip any DevTrack-specific references",
    "3. Verify multi-project readiness — project switching, profile persistence across projects",
    "4. End-to-end Landmark initialization test — the real dogfood validation",
    "5. Removed max 3 NOW WIP limit per user request",
    "6. Continue epic-hierarchy-ui if time permits"
  ],
  "context": "User exhausted but motivated. Session 10 was biggest ever (14 commits, $50 AI spend). Docs system built twice. Now validating everything works before porting to Landmark."
