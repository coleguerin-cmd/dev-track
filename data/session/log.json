Then iterated on the UI based on user feedback: markdown rendering for summaries (fixed truncation bug in recorder), time filters, analytics charts with muted colors, right sidebar entity breakdown. Pivoted to chat agent improvements after browser testing revealed 3 issues: (1) agent suggests code edits it can't do, (2) zero process transparency during execution, (3) no session-level change tracking. Built all three fixes: system prompt scope boundaries, AgentActivityPanel with step counter and tool visibility, Pillar-style SessionChangesTray. Fixed ISS-035 (config shallow merge — first bug found by our own chat agent), discovered ISS-039 (critical — refreshKey pattern was remounting all views on every WS event, destroying state across entire app), and fixed the AI config cache miss.

Voice-input driven session with rapid context switches between testing, feedback, and building. Showed strong pattern recognition connecting the Pillar changes tray to what DevTrack needed. The 'investigation + handoff' insight came from watching the chat agent work live — user saw the pattern before it was named. Frustration about cost ('fucking expensive') balanced by genuine excitement about what's being built ('this is incredible'). User's instinct to 'just build it all' is productive when paired with rapid iteration — session produced 7400 lines of code across 47 files."
