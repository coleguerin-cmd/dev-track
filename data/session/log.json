But the most important discovery was architectural: the AI doesn't reliably follow tracking rules, and adding more rules doesn't fix it. The solution is structural enforcement — either tool-level validation or a second AI dedicated to tracking. This is documented as ISS-006 (high severity), IDEA-014 (background AI watcher), and BN-009 (brain note). The cursor rule now has proper alwaysApply frontmatter and a mandatory checklist at the very top. Now items: test-integrations (pending), graph-layman-descriptions (new, pending). 4 open issues, 15 ideas captured. Dev servers running on ports 24680 (API) and 24682 (UI)."

Built the entire intelligence layer: 3-provider AIService, auto-discovering ModelRouter (58 models from OpenAI/Anthropic/Google), 25-tool registry, ChatService with multi-turn agent loop, SSE streaming API, and persistent resizable chat sidebar. Also shipped graph layman descriptions (ISS-007 resolved) and docs wiki overhaul. Fixed model routing (auto-discovery vs hardcoded IDs) and duplicate message bug (ISS-008). Business model decided: paid product, not open source (BN-013). 23 ideas captured (IDEA-001 through IDEA-023). 3 open issues (ISS-003 integrations, ISS-004 DnD, ISS-006 AI drift — ISS-009 dashboard cards also open). Key insight: the chat giving its own self-assessment that was 80% right but 20% stale IS the problem dev-track exists to solve. v0.1 goal: dogfood on Pillar. Next: polish chat, Settings UI, start background monitoring."
