  "summary": "Nightly audit #2 (Feb 9). Project at 72% health (↓2 from 74%). 11 systems assessed: 8 healthy, 3 degraded (CLI 48%, Integrations 42%, Cursor Rule 60%). CRITICAL PATH BLOCKER: AI chat agent has been in_progress for 3+ days without browser testing — this single item blocks the entire downstream pipeline (headless runner → automations → dogfooding). 4 open issues (ISS-003 medium, ISS-006 high, ISS-012 high, ISS-020 medium). No new commits since Feb 7 22:16 UTC. 15 data files modified but uncommitted. 37+ ideas tracked, 5 previously promoted, 2 at critical/exploring. Velocity: 54 items / 161 points across 5 tracked sessions (sessions 6-7 data gap persists). Next session MUST: (1) test AI chat in browser, (2) investigate Helicone failure, (3) commit pending data changes."
