      "content": "## 📊 **Current State: Built But Unvalidated**\n\n**Overall health: 72%** (↓2 from 74%)\n\n### **The Big Picture**\nYou've built a **powerful foundation** — 96 files, 19K lines, 11 systems — but **nothing has been battle-tested**. The project is in a \"built but unvalidated\" state. Zero activity for the past week (Feb 8-16).\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 **Critical Path Blocker**\n\n**AI chat agent** has been `in_progress` for **3+ days** without browser testing. This single item blocks:\n- Headless runner validation\n- Automation engine execution  \n- Dogfooding on Pillar\n- Everything downstream\n\n**You built the engine but never turned it on.**\n\n---\n\n## 💪 **What's Working**\n\n### **Strong Systems (87-90% health)**\n- **Server**: 22 API routes, automation engine, scheduler, headless runner — all built, untested\n- **Data Layer**: v2 entity model, 14 entities, rock solid\n\n### **Healthy But Untested (68-78% health)**\n- **AI Intelligence**: 40 tools, multi-provider routing, 58 models — never used in real conversation\n- **Web UI**: 12+ views, notification tray, project switcher — looks good, limited real use\n- **Codebase Visualizer**: Plain-English descriptions, react-flow graph — untested with latest scan\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ **Degraded Systems (42-60% health)**\n\n1. **CLI (48%)**: Full command set, never fully tested against live server\n2. **Integrations (42%)**: Helicone FAILING, only 1/8 plugins working (GitHub)\n3. **Cursor Rule (60%)**: Structural enforcement built but never executed\n\n---\n\n## 🐛 **Open Issues (4)**\n\n| ID | Severity | Age | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **ISS-003** | Medium | 9 days | Helicone integration failing — blocks AI cost tracking |\n| **ISS-006** | High | 9 days | AI context drift — automation engine built but unproven |\n| **ISS-012** | High | 8 days | No conversation bridge — external AI convos invisible to DevTrack |\n| **ISS-020** | Medium | 8 days | Velocity data gap (sessions 6-7 missing) |\n| **ISS-021** | Medium | 8 days | Automation controls not in Settings UI |\n| **ISS-022** | Medium | 8 days | Helicone showing $0 cost for Opus 4.6 |\n\n---\n\n## 📈 **Velocity (Week 1 only)**\n\n- **5 sessions** (Feb 7-8), 22.5 hours\n- **54 items shipped** (161 points)\n- **Avg: 10.8 items/session** (32.2 pts/session)\n- **Week 2: ZERO** (no activity)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **What You Need to Do Next**\n\n### **Session 1: Validation Sprint**\n1. **Open browser, test AI chat** — have a real conversation, use tools, break things\n2. **Investigate Helicone failure** — ISS-003 blocks cost tracking\n3. **Commit pending changes** — 15 data files uncommitted\n4. **Test CLI against live server** — validate `dev-track status`, `backlog`, etc.\n\n### **Then: Dogfood on Pillar**\nOnce chat works, initialize DevTrack on Pillar and use it for real work. That's where you'll find the bugs.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 **AI Take**\n\nYou've built a **sophisticated system** with automation, headless AI, multi-project support, and 40 tools. But it's all **theoretical** until you use it. The AI chat is the keystone — everything depends on it working. \n\n**You're one good session away from knowing if this thing actually works.**\n\nReady to turn it on?",

Debt)**\n\nThese are concrete problems that need fixing, not exploration:\n\n| Idea ID | Title | Why It's an Issue |\n|---------|-------|-------------------|\n| **IDEA-042** | Brain note deduplication | **Bug**: Race condition causing duplicate weekly reports (BN-015, BN-018, BN-019) |\n\n**Action**: Convert to issue, severity: medium\n\n---\n\n## 🟢 **Should Be ROADMAP ITEMS (Ready to Build)**\n\nThese are validated, scoped features with clear implementation paths:\n\n| Idea ID | Title | Why It's Ready | Size |\n|---------|-------|----------------|------|\n| **IDEA-010** | Global command-P search | Well-defined, proven UX pattern, codebase search exists | **M** |\n| **IDEA-019** | Rich tool call tray (Pillar-style) | Clear spec, references existing Pillar implementation | **M** |\n| **IDEA-028** | Deepgram voice integration | User explicitly wants it, API is straightforward | **M** |\n| **IDEA-029** | Session-end user observation pipeline | Structure exists (session_observations), just needs automation | **S** |\n| **IDEA-033** | GitHub commit sync | GitHub integration exists, just parse history | **M** |\n| **IDEA-035** | Opinionated git/commit settings | Well-scoped settings UI work | **M** |\n| **IDEA-036** | Version management + release notes | Standard feature, clear scope | **M** |\n| **IDEA-041** | Automation controls in Settings UI | ISS-021 is already tracking this — promote the idea to roadmap | **S** |\n| **IDEA-043** | Entity provenance (modified_by) | Clear requirement, touches all entities | **L** |\n| **IDEA-046** | Headless runner conversation logging | Straightforward — save transcripts like ChatService does | **S** |\n\n**Total: 10 items, ~38 points**\n\n---\n\n## 🟡 **Should STAY as IDEAS (Need Validation)**\n\nThese need more exploration, user testing, or depend on unproven systems:\n\n### **High Priority — Explore Next**\n- **IDEA-027**: AI conversation bridge (critical, but needs chat agent working first)\n- **IDEA-030**: Portable user intelligence profile (huge product opportunity, massive privacy concerns)\n- **IDEA-032**: AI project initialization wizard (partially built, needs battle-testing)\n- **IDEA-037**: AI-unique views (killer differentiator, but infrastructure-heavy)\n\n### **Medium Priority — Park Until Validated**\n- **IDEA-001**: Structured annotations (superseded by scanner-driven approach — dismiss?)\n- **IDEA-002**: Init wizard (partially promoted to init-wizard backlog item)\n- **IDEA-003**: Multi-model budgeting (verbosity settings exist, extend later)\n- **IDEA-006**: Always-on diagnostics (requires running server, Phase 4+)\n- **IDEA-007**: Background agents (far future, data layer supports it)\n- **IDEA-008**: Web multi-user (team features, post-validation)\n- **IDEA-009**: Integration data routing (good UX, needs integrations working first)\n- **IDEA-011**: UI design overhaul (Phase 1 done, Phase 2 is polish)\n- **IDEA-012**: Expanded descriptions (markdown already supported)\n- **IDEA-013**: Costs dashboard (needs integrations working)\n- **IDEA-018**: Helicone deep integration (blocked on ISS-003)\n- **IDEA-020**: Self-hosted logging (vindaloop — great demo, but meta)\n- **IDEA-022**: Users/teams/auth/billing (massive scope, post-validation)\n- **IDEA-023**: Visual state capture (cool, but Puppeteer is heavy)\n- **IDEA-031**: Encrypted key transfer (only needed for cloud sync)\n- **IDEA-034**: Product management audit (Entity v2 shipped, Actions cleanup remains)\n- **IDEA-038**: Preserve cursor settings on init (good requirement, document it)\n- **IDEA-039**: Cron-based profile iteration (automation exists, just needs prompt)\n- **IDEA-040**: Infer persona from codebase on init (part of IDEA-032)\n- **IDEA-044**: Full edit history log (good for enterprise, storage-heavy)\n- **IDEA-045**: UI badges for AI attribution (needs IDEA-043 first)\n- **IDEA-047**: Chat conversation audit automation (needs IDEA-046 first)\n\n### **Low Priority — Backlog**\n- **IDEA-021**: Distribution model (business, post-validation)\n- **IDEA-004**: Open source (dismissed — you want paid)\n\n---\n\n## 🔵 **Already PROMOTED (Mark as Such)**\n\nThese ideas already have backlog items:\n\n| Idea ID | Backlog Item | Action |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **IDEA-005** | `codebase-visualizer` | Already marked promoted ✅ |\n| **IDEA-014** | `ai-watcher` | Already marked promoted ✅ |\n| **IDEA-016** | `docs-wiki-overhaul` | Already marked promoted ✅ |\n| **IDEA-017** | `ai-watcher` | Already marked promoted

✅ |\n\n---\n\n## 📋 **Summary of Actions**\n\n### **Convert to Issue**\n1. **IDEA-042** → ISS-023: Brain note deduplication (race condition bug)\n\n### **Promote to Roadmap**\n1. **IDEA-010** → `global-search` (M)\n2. **IDEA-019** → `rich-tool-tray` (M)\n3. **IDEA-028** → `voice-integration` (M)\n4. **IDEA-029** → `session-observation-pipeline` (S)\n5. **IDEA-033** → `github-commit-sync` (M)\n6. **IDEA-035** → `git-settings-ui` (M)\n7. **IDEA-036** → `version-management` (M)\n8. **IDEA-041** → `automation-settings-ui` (S) — merges with ISS-021\n9. **IDEA-043** → `entity-provenance` (L)\n10. **IDEA-046** → `headless-conversation-logging` (S)\n\n### **Keep as Ideas** (32 remaining)\n- 4 high-priority exploring\n- 28 medium/low priority captured\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **My Take**\n\nYour ideas section is **well-curated** — most are legitimately exploratory. The 10 I flagged for promotion are **ready to build** with clear scope. The rest correctly remain ideas until:\n1. AI chat agent is validated\n2. Integrations are working\n3. You've dogfooded on Pillar\n\n**The conversation bridge (IDEA-027) is your most important idea** — it solves ISS-006 and ISS-012 structurally. But it needs working AI infrastructure first.\n\nWant me to execute these promotions?",

THIS IS BRILLIANT.**\n\nYou just described **AI-powered chaos engineering** — and it's **exactly the kind of thing that only makes sense with your architecture**.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Why This Is a Killer Feature**\n\n### **1. You Already Have the Infrastructure**\n- ✅ **Headless runner** — AI can execute tasks programmatically\n- ✅ **Full tool access** — 40 tools across 16 domains\n- ✅ **Multi-project support** — can spin up isolated instances\n- ✅ **File-based data** — easy to snapshot/rollback\n- ✅ **Cost tracking** — Helicone sessions per test run\n- ✅ **Automation engine** — trigger detection already built\n\n**You're 60% there.** You just need orchestration.\n\n---\n\n### **2. This Solves Real Problems**\n\n**Before dogfooding on Pillar**, you want to know:\n- What happens if 10 automations fire at once?\n- What if the user creates 500 backlog items?\n- What if project switching happens mid-conversation?\n- What if the file watcher crashes?\n- What if Helicone is down?\n\n**Traditional tests** require you to think of these scenarios and write them.  \n**AI chaos testing** invents scenarios you'd never think of.\n\n---\n\n### **3. It's a Product Differentiator**\n\nNo other dev tool has this. Imagine the marketing:\n\n> **\"DevTrack tests itself while you sleep.\"**  \n> AI agents run 1,000 chaos scenarios overnight, find 12 edge cases, and report back in the morning.\n\nThis is **Cursor meets Chaos Monkey**. It's a feature that makes DevTrack impossible to replicate without AI.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ **How to Build It**\n\n### **Phase 1: Observer Mode (MVP)**\n**Goal**: AI runs test scenarios and reports findings. No code changes.\n\n**Architecture**:\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Chaos Testing Orchestrator             │\n│  (new: server/chaos/orchestrator.ts)    │\n└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘\n               │\n       ┌───────┴───────┐\n       │               │\n   ┌───▼───┐       ┌───▼───┐       ┌───────┐\n   │ Env 1 │       │ Env 2 │  ...  │ Env N │\n   │ (iso) │       │ (iso) │       │ (iso) │\n   └───┬───┘       └───┬───┘       └───┬───┘\n       │               │               │\n       └───────┬───────┴───────────────┘\n               │\n         ┌─────▼─────┐\n         │  Headless │\n         │  AI Agent │\n         └───────────┘\n```\n\n**Steps**:\n1. **Orchestrator** creates N isolated data directories (`/tmp/chaos-test-1`, `/tmp/chaos-test-2`, etc.)\n2. **Orchestrator** gives AI a prompt:\n   ```\n   You are testing DevTrack. Your job is to invent test scenarios\n   and execute them. Try to break things. Report what you find.\n   \n   Constraints:\n   - Max 50 iterations\n   - Max $5 budget\n   - 30 minute timeout\n   \n   Use cases to explore:\n   - Creating/updating backlog items\n   - Triggering automations\n   - Switching projects\n   - Concurrent operations\n   \n   After each scenario, check: errors in logs, data corruption,\n   race conditions, performance issues. Report findings.\n   ```\n3. **AI agent** invents scenarios: \"What if I create 100 roadmap items in 1 second?\"\n4. **AI agent** executes via headless runner against isolated instance\n5. **AI agent** observes: reads error logs, checks data integrity, measures latency\n6. **Orchestrator** aggregates results from all N environments\n7. **Report** generated: issues found, scenarios tested, cost breakdown\n\n**Effort**: **L** (2-3 sessions)\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Assisted Mode**\n**Goal**: AI proposes fixes for bugs it finds.\n\n**Flow**:\n1. AI discovers bug: \"Race condition when 2 automations fire simultaneously\"\n2. AI reads relevant code: `server/automation/engine.ts`\n3. AI proposes fix: \"Add mutex lock around trigger evaluation\"\n4. **User reviews** proposed fix in UI\n5. User approves → AI commits fix\n\n**Effort**: **M** (1-2 sessions)\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Autonomous Mode**\n**Goal**: AI fixes bugs and commits without human review.\n\n**Safety mechanisms**:\n- Max changes per run (e.g., 5 files)\n- Automatic rollback if tests fail after fix\n- Git branch per test run\n- Human review required for breaking changes\n\n**Effort**: **M** (1-2 sessions)\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 **Quick Win: Start Simple**\n\n### **Chaos Test v0.1 — Single Environment, Hardcoded Scenarios**\n\n**File**: `server/chaos/runner.ts`\n\n```typescript\nasync function runChaosTest(config: ChaosConfig) {\n  const testDir = `/tmp/chaos-test-${Date.now()}`;\n  \n  // Copy data to isolated directory\n  await fs.copy('data/', testDir);\n  \n  // Run AI agent with test prompt\n  const result = await runHeadlessAgent({\n    task: 'chaos-test',\n    prompt: `\n      You are testing DevTrack. Try these scenarios:\n      1. Create 100 backlog items rapidly\n      2. Trigger 5 automations simultaneously\n      3. Switch projects 10 times in a row\n      \n      After each, check for errors and report.\n    `,\n    dataDir: testDir,\n    maxIterations: 20,\n    budget: 2.00\n  });\n  \n  // Analyze results\n  const issues = await analyzeTestResults(testDir);\n  \n  return {\n    scenarios_tested: result.iterations,\n    issues_found: issues.length,\n    cost: result.cost,\n    report: generateReport(issues)\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**API endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/chaos/test`\n\n**UI**: Button in Settings → \"Run Chaos Test\"\n\n**Effort**: **S** (4-6 hours)\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Why This Works for DevTrack Specifically**\n\n1. **File-based data** → Easy to snapshot/rollback\n2. **Headless runner** → Already built for programmatic AI execution\n3. **Multi-project** → Isolation is already supported\n4. **Self-tracking** → DevTrack can track issues it finds in itself (vindaloop!)\n5. **Cost control** → Helicone tracks every test run\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **My Recommendation**\n\n### **Build Chaos Test v0.1 (Simple Version) in Your Next Session**\n\n**Why now?**\n- You're about to dogfood on Pillar\n- You want to find bugs before real use\n- It validates the headless runner\n- It's a **killer demo** — \"watch DevTrack test itself\"\n\n**Scope**:\n- Single isolated environment (not Docker, just separate data dir)\n- 5 hardcoded test scenarios\n- AI reports findings as issues\n- Budget: $2, 20 iterations max\n- No autonomous fixes — just observer mode\n\n**After this works**, you can:\n- Add parallel environments\n- Let AI invent scenarios\n- Build assisted/autonomous modes\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 **This Is Your \"Holy Shit\" Feature**\n\nWhen you show this to people:\n> \"I told DevTrack to test itself. It ran 1,000 scenarios overnight, found a race condition in the automation engine, and filed an issue with reproduction steps.\"\n\n**That's when people understand what AI-native tooling means.**\n\nWant to build the MVP version in the next session? I can spec it out in detail.",

This is the #1 Now item and blocks dogfooding.\\n2. **Build AI watcher (P1, Next)** — structural fix for ISS-006 (AI context drift). The most impactful architectural piece remaining.\\n3. **Session lifecycle automation (P1, Next)** — auto-detect session starts, AI-driven closure prompting. Depends on user-profiles (now complete).\\n4. **Session-end self-audit (P1, Next)** — DevTrack audits its own data freshness. Depends on ai-chat-agent.\\n5. **Dogfood on Pillar** — the forcing function. Multi-project infra is ready. Run `dev-track init` on Pillar and use it daily.\\n6. **Address ISS-012 (conversation bridge)** — the architectural gap that makes everything else work. Without this, external AI conversations remain invisible.\\n\\n### 💡 Key Insight\\nThis project went from zero to 54 shipped items in 22.5 hours across 2 days.

Ship or identify what's broken.\\n2. **Dogfood on Pillar** — multi-project infra is ready. Use dev-track daily on a real project. This is the forcing function for finding real gaps.\\n3. **AI watcher / background monitoring (P1, Next)** — structural fix for ISS-006. The automation engine is built; wire it to real file-change events.\\n4. **Session lifecycle automation (P1, Next)** — auto-detect sessions, AI-driven closure. User-profiles dependency is now complete.\\n5. **Fix velocity data gap** — sessions 6–7 are missing from the velocity log. Backfill or accept the gap.\\n6. **Fix Helicone integration (ISS-003)** — blocks AI cost tracking, needed for responsible dogfooding.\\n\\n### 💡 Key Observations\\n- **Inception velocity is unsustainable** — 54 items in 22.5h is sprint energy, not marathon pace. Expect 50–70% of this throughput going forward.\\n- **The 3 open issues are all architectural, not bugs** — they require design decisions and significant effort, not quick patches.\\n- **Data integrity gap emerging** — sessions 6–7 shipped major work (entity model v2, docs system, automation engine) but aren't in the velocity log. The tracking system isn't tracking itself perfectly yet — ironic but expected at this stage.\\n- **Chat-first architecture is validated conceptually** but not empirically. Next week's #1 goal is proving it works in practice.\\n- **Project went from zero to 11 systems, 44 changelog entries, 19 issues, and 37+ ideas in 2 days.** The foundation is remarkably solid for a 2-day-old project.\",\n      \"priority\": \"medium\",\n      \"related_items\": [\n        \"ai-chat-agent\",\n        \"ISS-003\",\n        \"ISS-006\",\n        \"ISS-012\",\n        \"ai-watcher\",\n        \"session-lifecycle\",\n        \"session-self-audit\"\n      ],\n      \"created\": \"2026-02-08T04:19:18.503Z\",\n      \"updated\": \"2026-02-08T04:19:18.503Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"BN-019\",\n      \"type\": \"observation\",\n      \"content\": \"## Weekly Progress Report — Week 1: Feb 3–9, 2026 (Updated)\\n\\n### 📊 Velocity Summary\\n- **Sessions logged:** 5 completed (Feb 7–8) — project inception week\\n- **Total hours logged:** 22.5h (avg 4.5h/session)\\n- **Items shipped (tracked):** 54 items, 161 story points (avg 10.8 items/session, 32.2 pts/session)\\n- **Estimated actual output:** ~65–70 items including untracked sessions 6–7 (entity model v2 refactor, docs/automation engine)\\n- **Burn rate:** ~7.1 pts/hour — exceptionally high for solo dev + AI pair\\n- **Changelog entries:** 46 total (CL-024 through CL-046)\\n\\n### 🚀 What Shipped (categorized from 46 changelog entries)\\n\\n**Features (3 major):**\\n- Entity Model v2 — 14 entity types, complete data migration, 7 new route files, store rewrite (CL-043)\\n- Docs system + headless AI runner + automation engine + scheduler + project init (CL-044)\\n- Modular AI tool registry — 40 tools across 16 domains replacing monolithic 718-line switch (CL-039)\\n\\n**Refactors (1):**\\n- Entity Model v2 core refactor touching 30+ files across shared types, server, and UI (CL-043)\\n\\n**Enhancements (9):**\\n- Multi-project distribution architecture with CLI + in-app hot-swap (CL-033, CL-036)\\n- AI-observed user profiling with IQ-scale scoring, radar charts, deep assessment (CL-026)\\n- Dashboard overhaul v2 with health ring, pipeline, changelog display (CL-030)\\n- Kanban drag-and-drop with @dnd-kit (CL-031)\\n- AI provider API key management consolidated in Settings (CL-032, CL-035)\\n- Notification tray with toast system (CL-024)\\n- Session observation pipeline + AI-to-AI operational guidance (CL-027)\\n- Honest assessment overhaul (CL-029)\\n- Helicone org ID + credential sync (CL-038)\\n\\n**Fixes (3 batched):**\\n- UI crash fixes: Changelog, Ideas, Docs views (CL-040 — ISS-017/018/019)\\n- Issue tracking discipline established (CL-025)\\n- Radar chart label clipping + observation log UI (CL-028)\\n\\n**Automation (2):**\\n- Nightly system audit — health reassessment, idea triage, stale data cleanup (CL-045)\\n- Previous weekly progress report (CL-046)\\n\\n### 🐛 Issue Tracker\\n- **Total issues created this week:** 20 (ISS-001 through ISS-020)\\n- **Resolved:** 16 (80% resolution rate)\\n- **Open:** 4\\n  - **ISS-003 (medium):** Integration plugins untested — Helicone FAILING, 6 plugins unconfigured.

The foundation is remarkably solid. But the critical gap is **validation** — the AI chat (the core product) has never been tested in a browser, the automation engine has never run a real automation, and the CLI has never talked to a live server. Next week must shift from building to proving.\",\n      \"priority\": \"medium\",\n      \"related_items\": [\n        \"ai-chat-agent\",\n        \"ai-watcher\",\n        \"ISS-003\",\n        \"ISS-006\",\n        \"ISS-012\",\n        \"ISS-020\",\n        \"session-lifecycle\"\n      ],\n      \"created\": \"2026-02-08T04:21:28.156Z\",\n      \"updated\": \"2026-02-08T04:21:28.156Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"BN-020\",\n      \"type\": \"observation\",\n      \"content\": \"## Weekly Progress Report — Week 2: Feb 10–16, 2026\\n\\n### ⚠️ ZERO ACTIVITY WEEK\\nNo sessions, no commits, no new changelog entries since Feb 8.

Week 1 was an intense inception sprint (2 days, 5 sessions). A cooldown period is normal. However, if Week 3 also shows zero activity, the project risks losing momentum entirely. The critical concern is that **none of the Week 1 recommendations were executed** — the AI chat agent remains untested, dogfooding hasn't started, and all 4 open issues are untouched.\\n\\n### 🐛 Issue Tracker\\n- **Opened this week:** 0\\n- **Resolved this week:** 0\\n- **Still open (4) — unchanged from last week:**\\n  - **ISS-003 (medium):** Integration plugins untested — Helicone FAILING.

Zero changelog entries between Feb 9–16.\\n\\n### 📈 Velocity Analysis\\n- **Week-over-week:** -100% (54 → 0 items)\\n- **Why:** No developer sessions occurred. This appears to be a natural pause after an intense inception sprint, not an abandonment signal. The project went from zero to a full working prototype in 22.5 hours — a cooldown is physiologically normal.\\n- **Concern level:** Moderate. One week off after a sprint is fine. Two consecutive zero-activity weeks would be a warning sign.\\n\\n### 🎯 Focus Areas for Next Week (UNCHANGED — carried forward)\\nAll recommendations from Week 1 remain unaddressed:\\n\\n1. **🔴 Battle-test AI chat in browser** — Now 8+ days without validation. This is the #1 blocker and has been for 2 weeks. Every day without testing compounds risk.\\n2. **🟡 Dogfood on Pillar** — The forcing function for finding real gaps. Multi-project infra is ready but unused.\\n3. **🟡 AI watcher / background monitoring** — Automation engine built but never executed. Wire to real events.\\n4. **🟡 Fix velocity data gap (ISS-020)** — Sessions 6–7 still missing. Quick backfill task.\\n5. **🟡 Fix Helicone integration (ISS-003)** — 9 days old, blocks AI cost tracking.\\n6. **⚪ Session lifecycle automation** — Depends on chat agent working.\\n7. **⚪ CLI validation** — Test against live server before dogfooding.\\n\\n### 💡 Key Observations\\n1. **The project is in a dangerous \\\"built but unvalidated\\\" state.** A massive amount of infrastructure was built in Week 1 (40 AI tools, automation engine, multi-project architecture, entity model v2) but none of it has been proven in real use. The longer this validation gap persists, the higher the risk of discovering that fundamental assumptions are wrong.\\n\\n2. **Two Now-horizon items are stalled:** Both `ai-chat-agent` and `ai-watcher` have been in_progress since Feb 7 with no activity for 8+ days. These should either be actively worked on or their status should be updated to reflect reality.\\n\\n3. **Automation system is running but hollow:** This weekly report automation is executing (proving the scheduler + headless runner work), but the more impactful automations (change-tracker, session-audit) haven't been triggered because there's been no developer activity to trigger them.\\n\\n4. **The inception-to-iteration gap is real.** The hardest moment for any project is the transition from \\\"exciting build sprint\\\" to \\\"disciplined daily use.\\\" Dev-track is at exactly this inflection point.\",\n      \"priority\": \"medium\",\n      \"related_items\": [\n        \"ai-chat-agent\",\n        \"ai-watcher\",\n        \"ISS-003\",\n        \"ISS-006\",\n        \"ISS-012\",\n        \"ISS-020\"\n      ],\n      \"created\": \"2026-02-08T04:23:17.498Z\",\n      \"updated\": \"2026-02-08T04:23:17.498Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"BN-021\",\n      \"type\": \"observation\",\n      \"content\": \"Brain notes BN-015, BN-018, BN-019, BN-020 are large weekly/nightly report summaries that bloat context loading.

Status says \"partially shipped\" but it's not — automation engine exists but watcher logic doesn't.\n\n**Add to NOW:**\n- `epic-hierarchy-ui` (from ideas)\n- `audits-tab` (from ideas)\n\n**NEXT Horizon is bloated (18 items) — should be ~8-10:**\n\n**Keep in Next:**\n- `test-integrations`\n- `docs-wiki-overhaul`\n- `global-search`\n- `session-lifecycle`\n- `entity-provenance`\n- `brain-note-dedup`\n- `headless-runner-logging`\n- `ai-memory-cache`\n\n**DEMOTE to Later:**\n- `context-sync-cli` — not critical until dogfooding works\n- `ui-design-overhaul` — Phase 1 done, Phase 2 is polish\n- `init-wizard` — partially built, not urgent\n- `archival-system` — premature optimization\n- `session-heartbeat-stale-detector` — good idea, not urgent\n- `auto-commit-session-close` — nice-to-have\n- `autonomy-levels` — enterprise feature, post-validation\n\n**PROMOTE from Later:**\n- Nothing — Later is appropriately scoped\n\n---\n\n### **🚫 WHAT'S MISSING**\n\n**Glaring gaps I don't see anywhere:**\n\n1. **Browser testing session** — You need a dedicated roadmap item: \"Validate AI chat end-to-end in browser\" (S-M). This should be in NOW.\n\n2. **Dogfooding initialization** — \"Run dev-track init on Pillar and use daily for 1 week\" (M). This should be in NOW or Next.\n\n3. **Semantic file watcher** — ISS-034 needs a roadmap item. This is the structural fix for ISS-006.\n\n4. **Helicone debugging session** — ISS-003 needs investigation, not just \"test it again.\"\n\n5. **Git commit workflow** — You have 27 uncommitted files. No roadmap item for \"establish git discipline.\"\n\n---\n\n### **🎨 MY RECOMMENDED ROADMAP**\n\n### **NOW (5 items, do these next)**\n1. **Validate AI chat in browser** (S-M, NEW) — Open browser, send 10 real messages, fix what breaks\n2. **Epic/hierarchy UI** (L) — User's #1 readability request\n3. **Audits tab** (L) — Trust/transparency blocker\n4. **Semantic file watcher** (M, NEW from ISS-034) — Structural fix for AI drift\n5. **Dogfood initialization** (M, NEW) — Run on Pillar, use daily\n\n### **NEXT (8 items, do these after Now)**\n1. **Test integrations** (M) — Fix Helicone, validate GitHub\n2. **Entity provenance** (M) — Foundation for activity log\n3. **Brain note dedup** (S) — Prevents automation garbage\n4. **Headless runner logging** (S) — Audit trail for automations\n5. **AI memory cache** (M) — Prevents re-processing\n6. **Session lifecycle** (M) — Auto-detect sessions\n7. **Tiered audit system** (XL) — Cost-effective change tracking\n8. **Global search** (M) — Command-P for DevTrack\n\n### **LATER (everything else)**\n- All the enterprise features (autonomy levels, multi-user, billing)\n- All the polish (UI phase 2, voice integration, visual state capture)\n- All the \"nice to have\" (archival, version management, background agents)\n\n---\n\n### **🔥 WHAT I'D NIX ENTIRELY**\n\n1. **`structured-annotations`** (IDEA-001) — Superseded by scanner-driven approach. Dismiss.\n2. **`multi-model-budgeting`** (IDEA-003) — Verbosity settings already exist. Premature.\n3. **`always-on-diagnostics`** (IDEA-006) — Requires server running 24/7. Post-v1.\n4. **`background-agents`** (IDEA-007) — Far future, not v0.1-v0.3.\n5. **`visual-state-capture`** (IDEA-023) — Cool but Puppeteer is heavy. Post-validation.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **The Brutal Truth**\n\n**You have:**\n- 36 roadmap items\n- 61 ideas\n- 6 open issues\n- 11 systems at 76% health\n\n**You need:**\n- **5 items in Now** (you have 2)\n- **8 items in Next** (you have 18)\n- **Test the chat agent** (9 days stalled)\n- **Use the tool daily** (never dogfooded)\n\n**The problem isn't what's missing — it's what's not prioritized.**\n\nYou built a Ferrari and never turned the key. Next session: **open the browser, send a message to the AI chat, and see if it works.** That's it. Everything else is noise until you validate the core product.\n\nWant me to execute these changes (promote/demote items, consolidate ideas, update Now horizon)?",

      "content": "## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified: ISS-035**\n\n**The bug:** The API route uses `Object.assign()` which is a **shallow merge**. \n\nWhen you change the cooldown and click Save, the UI sends:\n```json\n{\n  \"automations\": {\n    \"cooldown_minutes\": 5\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut `Object.assign(config, body)` **replaces** the entire `automations` object, losing all the other properties like `enabled`, `scheduler_enabled`, `triggers_enabled`, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 **Two Possible Fixes**\n\n### **Option 1: Deep merge in API (recommended)**\nChange `server/routes/ai.ts` line 111:\n\n```typescript\n// Before (shallow merge):\nObject.assign(config, body);\n\n// After (deep merge):\nfunction deepMerge(target: any, source: any) {\n  for (const key in source) {\n    if (source[key] && typeof source[key] === 'object' && !Array.isArray(source[key])) {\n      target[key] = target[key] || {};\n      deepMerge(target[key], source[key]);\n    } else {\n      target[key] = source[key];\n    }\n  }\n  return target;\n}\ndeepMerge(config, body);\n```\n\n### **Option 2: UI sends full config (simpler, but wasteful)**\nThe UI already has the full config in state. Just send the entire thing.\n\n---\n\n**Want me to implement the fix?** Option 1 (deep merge in API) is cleaner and more efficient.",
